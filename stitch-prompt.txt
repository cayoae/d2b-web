RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
- Desktop: 1400px max-width container
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (2-column grids become 1-2 columns)

- Maintain 24px horizontal padding on mobile

INTERACTIONS & ANIMATIONS:
- All transitions: 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Button hovers: Background and text color change
- Card hovers: Subtle lift (translateY -4px) and shadow
- Link hovers: Color change to lime
- Smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
- Fade-in animations on scroll for section content (subtle, fast)

ACCESSIBILITY:
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Focus states: 2px outline in lime or black
- Alt text for all icons and images
- ARIA labels for icon buttons
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Form validation messages clearly visible

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PREFERENCES:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, section, article, footer)
- CSS Grid for layouts, Flexbox for components
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Optimize for performance (lazy loading, efficient CSS)
- Clean, organized code structure

=== CONTENT TONE ===
- Professional but approachable
- Technical but not jargon-heavy
- Results-focused and specific (use numbers, metrics)
- Confident without being arrogant
